# Tengwar Transcriber

Tengwar is a type of Elvish scripting. My transcriber simply converts English characters to Tengwar, it will not translate English to Tengwar.
This tool is only useful for learning how to write your name in Elvish script.

How I interpret 'r' :
`as in 'car'` - means 'r' is preceded by a vowel
`as in 'red'` - means everything else
There is speculation that the variation is either a trilled 'r' or a non trilled 'r' (according to the spoken Elvish)

How I identify silent 'e' :
Most cases of a silent 'e' occur at the end of a word. This is currently how my algorithm works.

Outstanding Cases :
* handling y consonant case
* Alternate forms of 'z' and 's'

I understand that there are many edge cases that are not handled by my algorithm. I plan to harden these cases in the future.
